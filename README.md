## purpose
Learning React `useState` - allows functional components to manage and track local state.

## concepts

- triggers re renders - when setter function is called with a new value,react automatically re-renders the component to reflect the change in UI.
- returns an array with two values- the current state and the set function that lets you update the state to a new value and triggers re-render
